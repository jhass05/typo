UPGRADING TO TYPO 5.3 HOWTO

*** BEFORE UPGRADING ***

Pre migration steps are divided into 2 categories : things you should do, and things you must do.

You should make a backup of your current blog, either using a file transfer software or an archiver like zip or tar.

You should make a backup of your database, using either mysqldump, pgdump or phpmyadmin, whichever you feel safe with.

If you're using a pre 5.0 version, you should remove all the following sidebars before migrating:

* AIM presence
* Audioscrobbler
* Backpack
* Delicious
* Flickr
* 43 things
* 43 places
* Magnolia
* Recent comments
* Tada
* Upcoming
* Xbox

These sidebars have been removed from Typo core at 5.0 and are now hosted on a separate repository. You can also migrate, then reinstall those plugins before trying to access your blog frontend or admin.

If you're using a Typo version priori to 5.1, you must manually remove the lib directory inside your typo install.

If you're using a third party theme, you'll have do some changes to your template as well. This is explained later.

*** UPGRADING ***

Upgrading should be a really easy process, depending on how you installed your typo first.

** UPGRADING WITH TYPO INSTALLER FROM TYPO 2.0 to 5.0 **

Automagically upgrading Typo 2.0 to 5.0 using Typo instaler is not possible, but you can catch on the train anyway, it will just be a little harder. By default Typo uses MySQL database. If you want to use something else, check our installation documentation.

* UPGRADING FILES *

First, move your production Typo directory somewhere else :

$ mv typo_path old_typo

If you have root access to your host, launch:

$ sudo gem install typo
$ typo install typo_path

or 

$ sudo gem update typo
$ typo install typo_path

If you don't have root access, things are just a bit more complicated

$ export GEM_PATH=~/gems
$ gem install -i ~/gems typo
$ ~/gems/bin/typo install typo_path

or

$ export GEM_PATH=~/gems
$ gem update -i ~/gems typo
$ ~/gems/bin/typo install typo_path

Then, move your theme (which is certainly not compatible anymore at all), your database confiuration and your uploaded files to your new blog:

$ mv old_typo/public/files/* typo_path/public/files
$ mv old_typo/themes/your_theme typo_path/themes/
$ mv old_typo/config/database.yml typo_path/config

Ensure all your typo files have the good perms, then restart your Typo instance.

* UPGRADING DATABASE *

Login in to your Typo admin using your favourite web browser. You'll access to the database migration page. Just click on the "migrate" button.

If something goes wrong, go back to your terminal, and run

$ cd typo_path
$ rake RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate

If things really goes wrong, then please ask for help on the Typo mailing list or on IRC #typo@irc.freenode.net

** UPGRADING WITH TYPO INSTALLER FROM TYPO 5.0 and later **

* UPGRADING FILES *

First, install or update your Typo gem.

If you have root access to your host, launch:

$ sudo gem install typo
$ typo install typo_path

or 

$ sudo gem update typo
$ typo install typo_path

If you don't have root access, things are just a bit more complicated

$ export GEM_PATH=~/gems
$ gem install -i ~/gems typo
$ ~/gems/bin/typo install typo_path

or

$ export GEM_PATH=~/gems
$ gem update -i ~/gems typo
$ ~/gems/bin/typo install /some/path

Ensure all your typo files have the good perms, then restart your Typo instance.

* UPGRADING DATABASE *

Login in to your Typo admin using your favourite web browser. You'll access to the database migration page. Just click on the "migrate" button.

If something goes wrong, go back to your terminal, and run

$ cd typo_path
$ rake RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate

If things really goes wrong, then please ask for help on the Typo mailing list or on IRC #typo@irc.freenode.net

*** UPGRADING YOUR THEME ***

** UPGRADING FROM TYPO 5.2 **

* In articles/_comment_box.html.erb use @article.comment_url instead of comments_path(@article)

* all link preview_new_comment_path(@article) are changed to @article.preview_comment_url

* all link url_for formatted_article_path(@article, :rss) are changed to @article.feed_url(:rss)

* all link formatted_article_url(@article, @format) are changed to   @article.permalink_by_format(@format)

* The classical search has moved to sidebar. So if you want, you can delete the render of shared/search in your layout and use the search_sidebar instead of.
